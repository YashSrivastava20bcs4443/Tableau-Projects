# Netflix-DashBoard
By designing a Netflix dashboard using Tableau with these key metrics and visualizations, stakeholders within Netflix, including executives, product managers, and content creators, can gain valuable insights into user behavior, content performance, and overall business performance. These insights can then be used to drive data-informed decisions, improve user experience, optimize content recommendations, and enhance the platform's competitive edge in the streaming industry.
